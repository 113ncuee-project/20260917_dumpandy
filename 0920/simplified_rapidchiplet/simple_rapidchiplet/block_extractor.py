"""Semantic block extraction for the simplified RapidChiplet IR.

The extraction boundary follows the model's native semantics instead of an
arbitrary MAC-count split:

* a block is a useful tensor-to-tensor unit;
* fused operators such as Conv+BN+Activation stay together;
* residual/concat branches are closed before the block boundary;
* the DSE agent only sees the resulting block graph.

The current project receives model metadata through ``models.json`` rather
than importing PyTorch or ONNX at runtime.  ``load_models`` is therefore the
small parser/front-end, while this module owns the semantic-block validation
and the compatibility fallback for old stage-only configs.
